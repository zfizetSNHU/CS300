What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Throughout this course, the problem that I was solving for each project revoled around different data structures (vectors/arrays, trees, hash tables, etc.) and algorithms used when utilizing said data structures. For our final project, we were tasked with evaluating the runtime and memory for
a few different data structures and decide which type of structure to use for the final project based off of that analysis. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data structures are important to understand because data structures organize and manage the data you're dealing with in a given situation. It's important to consider the aspects of the data you're handling, because this can directly impact which type of data structure you choose to employ.
Data structures directly control the efficiency, scalability, and organization of your code. With this in mind, I approached the problem by considering the requirements we were given for the project, what kind of data we were working with, and how that data was going to be used. 
After considering all of those factors and evaluating the runtime analysis I created, that led me to determine the best structure to use to handle the problem we were given.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The number one way I overcame any problems or roadblocks while working through this course was by constantly referencing our zyBook. Whenever I was working on work from this class, I always had our zyBook opened on another monitor so that I could quickly reference it whenever I was having an
issue with something. Additionally, I would also seek out information online whenever I was having trouble understanding something. This includes utilizing websites like w3schools.com, Stack Overflow, Reddit, etc., so that I could develop a better understanding of what was being asked of me 
and how I could solve the problem given.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by making me think about what kind of data structures I'm going to use before I even begin writing any code. In previous classes I have taken, we're given a problem to solve and I would basically just
start working on the problem before I even considered what kind of data I was working with or how I was going to write code to handle that data. Now, after taking this class, before I start writing anything, I'll more carefully consider the data I'm working with, and what kind of data structure
I should be using with said data. This project has given me a deeper appreciation and understanding of some of the Database classes I have taken and how that logic and problem-solving can be used in conjunction with creating code for future projects.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project has evolved the way I write programs by giving me a proper understanding on data structures and algorithms. It's important to consider data structures when writing your code, because with the wrong type of data structure, your code can eventually become un-maintainable and unreadable,
which will eventually lead to bigger problems down the road when you eventually have to re-write and re-design and entire project because it became impossible to maintain. Even when working with small amounts data or simple data, it's important to consider its adaptability and readability so that if you have
to come back and change something or if another developer comes after you to edit your code, they can understand it and make whatever changes they need without having to do an incredible amount of work. Essentially, by being careful in the present and ensuring your code is maintainable, you're reducing the potential
amount of work that will need to be done in the future. "Measure twice, cut once."
